# Gosper's Summation Algorithm
An implementation of Gosper's algorithm for computing indefinite sums of hypergeometric functions. 

## Overview
This project contains a Maple implementation and a Python implementation of Gosper's algorithm.

## Installation

### Maple
The Maple implementation requries Maple 2022. It might work on other Maple versions but this is untested.

**Note**
The Maple implementation is currently broken.

### Python
The Python implementation requires Python 3.9.6, Sympy 1.11.1 and any compatible version of pytest. It might work on other versions but this is untested. To run the test suite, execute
```
pytest .
```
in the root directory of the project.
