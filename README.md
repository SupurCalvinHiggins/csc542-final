# Gosper's Summation Algorithm
An implementation of Gosper's algorithm for computing indefinite sums of hypergeometric functions. 

## Overview
This project contains a Maple implementation and a Python implementation of Gosper's algorithm.

## Installation

### Maple
The Maple implementation requries Maple 2022. It might work on other Maple versions but this is untested.

### Python
The Python implmenetation requires Python 3.9.6 and Sympy 1.11.1. It might work on other versions but this is untested. To run the test suite, execute
```
pytest .
```
in the root directory of the project.
